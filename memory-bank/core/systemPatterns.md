# System Architecture and Patterns

## Overall Architecture
- Event-driven processing pipeline
- Modular components with clear interfaces
- Persistent state management via Memory Bank
- API-based integration with external platforms

## Core Design Patterns
1. **Pipeline Pattern** for image and data processing
2. **Repository Pattern** for data access
3. **Strategy Pattern** for platform-specific adaptations
4. **Observer Pattern** for process monitoring
5. **Factory Pattern** for content generation

## Component Relationships
- **Image Processor** handles grouping and classification
- **Content Generator** creates listings based on image data
- **Platform Manager** handles integration with sales channels
- **Memory Manager** maintains persistent knowledge
- **Analytics Engine** processes sales data for insights
